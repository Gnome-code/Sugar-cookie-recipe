Step 1
Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F. In a small bowl, stir together the parts of flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Set aside the bowl to rest.

Step 2
Place the softened butter and sugar into a large bowl and then mix until the butter mixture is pale yellow, light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Slowly put in and blend in the dry ingredients. Take out the dough in teaspoon sized pieces and roll into balls. Place the dough balls onto ungreased cookie sheets.

Step 3
Bake 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the cookies turn golden. Let the cookies stand on cookie sheet two minutes before removing so they can cool down on wire racks.
